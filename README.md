# OpenFOAMTrainingCombustionTest
**OpenFOAM Training: Combustion with OpenSMOKE++ (3-5 July 2017, Brussels)**

This repository contains the source code to test the OpenFOAM environment to be used in the following training session, scheduled for **Tuesday, 4 July: Use of external libraries for chemistry - Getting started with OpenSMOKE++**

It is important that you test your environment before the begining of the training, by following the instructions which are reported below. I also recommend to perform the present test, only once the `SandiaD_LTS` case has been successfully simulated, according to the instructions provided by Prof. Francesco Contino.

# Prerequisites
* OpenFOAM-dev or OpenFOAM-4.x (https://openfoam.org/)
* Boost C++ (http://www.boost.org/)

# Preparation of your environment
The OpenSMOKE++ library relies some third-party libraries for some important tasks:
* Eigen++ (for linear algebra operations)
* RapidXML (for XML file management)
* Boost C++ (for string manipulation, file system operations, etc.)

The Eigen++ and RapidXML libraries do not require precompilation, since they are entirely based on header files and they are provided together with the OpenSMOKE++ libraries. The Boost C++ libraries are not provided with OpenSMOKE++. Usually they are already available in your Linux distribution. If not, you need to install them.  

If the distribution you are using is Ubuntu or SuSE, you can follow procedure 1 reported below.  

If this is not the case, compilation from source code is required (see procedure 2).

## 1. Installation of Boost C++ (Ubuntu and SuSE)
For Ubuntu and SuSE distribution you can use one of the following commands:

**Ubuntu (versions 14.04 or above)**  
`sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`

**SuSE (OpenSuSE/SLES v12 or above, or Tumbleweed)**   
`sudo zypper install boost-devel`

## 2. Compilation and installation of Boost C++ from source code
If you cannot install the Boost C++ libraries using the commands reported above, you need to download the source code and compile it.

1. Download the source code from:  
https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.64.0/source/

2. Follow the compilation and installation instructions reported at:  
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html

After compilation and installation, set the environment variable pointing at the location where the compiled Boost C++ libraries have been installed (i.e. the folder containing the `include` and `lib` subfolders):

**bash or ksh**  
`export BOOST4OPENSMOKEPP=/path/to/boost`

**tcsh or csh**  
`setenv BOOST4OPENSMOKEPP /path/to/boost`

# Testing the environment
In order to check if the environment is correctly configured, we compile and run a simple application based on OpenSMOKE++ and OpenFOAM.
1. Go to the `TestEnvironment` folder
2. Compile the source code by typing: `wmake`
3. If compilation succeeded, run the solver by typing: `environmentTest`  

If everything was done properly, you should have the following output on the screen:
```
